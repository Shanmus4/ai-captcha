		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize React Project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks: one for initializing the React project with the TypeScript template using Vite or Create React App, a second for integrating and configuring Tailwind CSS according to its official documentation, and a third for creating the specified initial directory structure (`src/components`, `src/hooks`, etc.).",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational setup task with clear, well-documented steps. It's primarily configuration and doesn't involve complex logic, making it low complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Core UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks, one for each core UI component: `CaptchaContainer.tsx`, `TextInput.tsx`, and `SubmitButton.tsx`. The subtask for the button should include implementing its different visual states (neutral, success, error) via props.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves creating three separate, well-defined UI components. While each is relatively simple, creating all three and ensuring they are styled and prop-driven warrants a medium-low complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Lottie Animation Player",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks: first, install the `lottie-react` library. Second, create the `CatAnimation.tsx` component that wraps the Lottie player. Third, import and render the placeholder 'grumpy' animation JSON from the assets directory to verify the integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task is focused on integrating a single, well-documented third-party library. It involves creating one simple wrapper component and loading an asset, which is a low-complexity activity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend State Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, define the TypeScript interface for the captcha state. Second, scaffold the `useCaptchaState` custom hook. Third, implement the state management logic within the hook using `useState` or `useReducer` to handle all state properties. Fourth, write unit tests to verify the hook's state transitions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a custom hook to manage the application's core logic. Designing the state shape, implementing the reducer/state logic, and ensuring it's testable makes it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop LLM API Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, configure environment variable handling for the API key. Second, create the `src/services/aiService.ts` module and define the `analyzeText` function. Third, implement the `fetch` or `axios` POST request logic within the function. Fourth, set up a mock service worker or Jest mocks to test API success and failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This involves external communication, asynchronous logic, and security considerations (API key). While the call itself is simple, the surrounding setup (env vars, error handling, mocking) adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Sentiment and Humor Analysis Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, research and craft the system prompt instructing the LLM to return a specific JSON structure. Second, integrate this prompt into the `aiService.ts` call. Third, implement the logic to parse the JSON response from the LLM. Fourth, add a validation layer to handle malformed or incomplete JSON and ensure the data conforms to the `AIAnalysis` model.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in prompt engineering and the need to robustly handle unpredictable or malformed responses from the LLM. This is a high-risk, core logic task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Connect AI Analysis to UI State and Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks. First, create the `handleSubmit` function that is triggered by the submit button. Second, within this function, call the `analyzeText` service with the user's input. Third, based on the successful response from the service, use the state setters from the `useCaptchaState` hook to update the UI state (emotion, button state, completion status).",
			"reasoning": "This is a critical integration point connecting the frontend logic to the backend service. It involves managing the asynchronous data flow and updating multiple pieces of UI state, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Loading and API Error States",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, add `isLoading` and `apiError` fields to the `useCaptchaState` hook. Second, modify the submission logic to set `isLoading` during the API call and handle errors by setting `apiError`. Third, update the UI to disable the form and show a loading indicator when `isLoading` is true. Fourth, create and display a UI element for showing the `apiError` message to the user.",
			"reasoning": "While a common pattern, this task requires modifications in multiple places: the state hook, the API call logic (for try/catch), and the UI components. This coordination gives it a medium-low complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Multiple Lottie Animation Assets",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks. First, source and optimize the Lottie JSON files for all required emotions. Second, place these files into the `src/assets/animations` folder. Third, create a TypeScript file (e.g., `animationMap.ts`) that exports an object mapping emotion strings like 'happy' to their corresponding imported Lottie JSON data.",
			"reasoning": "This task is mostly about asset collection and organization. The coding part is minimal, involving creating a simple key-value map. The complexity is very low."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Dynamic Animation Controller",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, refactor the `CatAnimation.tsx` component to accept an `emotion` prop. Second, use the animation map from Task 9 to look up the correct animation data based on the prop. Third, use a `useEffect` hook that triggers when the `emotion` prop changes to update the animation data passed to the Lottie player. Fourth, use the Lottie player's imperative API to control the animation flow, ensuring the new animation plays correctly.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires reacting to prop changes to dynamically alter the behavior of a third-party library. It involves understanding the Lottie player's specific API for controlling playback, which makes it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Continuous Idle Animation Loop",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks. First, update the Lottie player configuration to make the default 'grumpy' animation loop. Second, add logic to the `CatAnimation` component to play non-default animations only once. Third, use the Lottie player's `onComplete` event handler to signal when a one-shot animation has finished, triggering a state change back to the looping 'grumpy' animation.",
			"reasoning": "This task adds more complex control flow to the animation component. Managing the sequence (idle -> reaction -> idle) and using the player's event system (`onComplete`) adds a layer of complexity beyond just swapping animations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design for Mobile and Desktop",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, apply Tailwind's responsive prefixes to the main layout components to handle mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Second, adjust typography and spacing for readability on all screen sizes. Third, ensure the cat animation container scales correctly without causing overflow. Fourth, perform a full responsive audit using browser developer tools and fix any layout issues.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving a good responsive layout requires careful planning and testing across multiple breakpoints. While Tailwind makes it easier, it's still an iterative process of tweaking styles for different screen sizes, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Accessibility (a11y)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 5 subtasks. First, ensure a logical keyboard navigation flow and visible focus states. Second, add necessary ARIA attributes like `aria-label` to controls and `aria-live` for status updates. Third, audit and correct all color contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA. Fourth, associate labels with form inputs. Fifth, perform a manual test of the entire user journey using a screen reader.",
			"reasoning": "Good accessibility is a specialized skill. It requires more than just following a simple checklist; it involves understanding user experience for those with disabilities and using specific tools for testing, making it moderately complex and crucial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 3 subtasks. First, create a detailed testing checklist covering all features, UI components, and user flows. Second, systematically execute this checklist on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Third, document any inconsistencies or bugs with screenshots and steps to reproduce in a bug tracking system.",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a procedural task. The complexity is not in writing new code but in the methodical process of testing and the potential for uncovering difficult-to-debug, browser-specific issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Deployment and Environment Variables",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into 4 subtasks. First, connect the project's Git repository to a hosting provider like Vercel or Netlify. Second, configure the project's build command and output directory in the provider's settings. Third, add the production API key as a secret environment variable via the provider's dashboard. Fourth, trigger a deployment to the main branch and verify the live site is working.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves interacting with a third-party CI/CD platform, which has its own configuration. Correctly managing sensitive environment variables is critical and adds to the complexity."
