			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Multiple Lottie Animation Assets",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of integrating multiple Lottie animations. The subtasks should cover sourcing and optimizing the animation files for 'happy', 'sad', and 'angry', creating a data structure in the code to map emotion strings to these animations, and implementing a temporary UI with buttons to test that each animation can be loaded and played correctly.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate primarily due to the asset sourcing and optimization, which is not a pure coding task and can be time-consuming. The actual code implementation (creating a map and test buttons) is straightforward. The subtasks separate the asset management work from the integration and testing work."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Dynamic Animation Controller",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task of creating a dynamic animation controller. Subtasks should include refactoring the `CatAnimation` component to be driven by a `currentEmotion` prop, implementing the `useEffect` logic to select and load the correct animation from the asset map when the prop changes, and investigating the Lottie player's API to implement a smooth transition between animations.",
			"reasoning": "This task has a medium-high complexity because it involves managing component state reactively with `useEffect`, handling side effects, and interacting with a third-party library's API for potentially non-trivial 'smooth transitions'. The end-to-end testing requirement also adds to the complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"title": "Implement Continuous Idle Animation Loop",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the continuous idle animation loop. Subtasks should cover configuring the Lottie player to loop the default 'grumpy' animation, using the player's `onComplete` event to detect when a one-shot emotional animation has finished, and implementing the state logic to automatically revert the `currentEmotion` back to 'grumpy' upon completion.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium. While the Lottie API features used (`loop`, `onComplete`) are simple, orchestrating them into a reliable state machine that correctly interrupts the idle loop, plays a new animation once, and then reverts requires careful state management within the React component lifecycle."
